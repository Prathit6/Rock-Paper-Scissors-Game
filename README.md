Projects are the best way to learn JavaScript, and Rock-Paper-Scissors is an excellent choice to start with.**

->About the Game:Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple hand game where two players simultaneously choose one of three shapes: rock, paper, or scissors.

->Rules:Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

I developed the logic for a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using JavaScript, with HTML for displaying the content and CSS for styling the appearance.

This project effectively demonstrates complex interactions between the user interface and JavaScript, making it accessible for individuals at any skill level.
